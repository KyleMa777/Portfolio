            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                SnapBuy is a course project created for a Prototyping &amp; Usability Testing class. 
                Based on the assigned theme, I designed SnapBuy as a mobile shopping app 
                that focuses on simplifying online shopping experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was responsible for the entire process: framing the problem, designing the interaction flows, building the prototype, and
                iterating based on usability feedback.

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p class="problem-intro">
        Through analyzing existing online shopping platforms, I identified three recurring issues
        that consistently disrupt users’ shopping experiences.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="problem-grid">

    <div class="problem-card hover-target">
        <span class="problem-tag">01</span>
        <h3>Overwhelming Advertising</h3>
        <p>
            Aggressive banners, pop-ups, and promotional layers...
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem-card hover-target">
        <span class="problem-tag">02</span>
        <h3>Overly Complex Interfaces</h3>
        <p>
            Dense layouts, excessive features, and unclear hierarchies...

    </div>

    <div class="problem-card hover-target">
        <span class="problem-tag">03</span>
        <h3>Constant Visual Distractions</h3>
        <p>
            Competing colors, motion effects, and non-essential UI elements...
        </p>
    </div>

</div>

<p class="problem-principle">
    SnapBuy was designed with a single core principle in mind:
    <span class="principle-highlight">Ultra minimalism with zero distraction.</span>
</p>





        
        <div class="content-wrapper">
            <h2>Initial Prototype</h2>
            <p>
                The initial version of SnapBuy focused on implementing the core purchasing flow: login, browse products, view product details, and checkout. At this stage, I prioritized layout over visual refinement to validate whether the overall journey made sense.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-wrapper">
            <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
            <p>
                I conducted 5 task-based usability testing with participants. Each person was asked to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Create an account or log in</li>
                <li>Find and select an iPhone product</li>
                <li>Complete the checkout with a saved card</li>
                <li>Confirm whether their order was successfully placed</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>Here are two key issues that surfaced:</p>
        </div>

        <div class="testing-insights">

            <div class="insight-card">
    <h4>Lack of Reviews for Decision-Making</h4>
    <p>
        In the early prototype, review content was missing, leaving users uncertain when making purchase decisions.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="insight-card">
    <h4>Unclear Product Information Structure</h4>
    <p>
        On the product detail page, technical specifications and key parameters were not clearly
        categorized. Users frequently asked where to find essential product information such as
        features, specifications.
    </p>

        <h3>Refining Visual Design</h3>
        <p>
            I refined the overall interface by enriching key visual elements such as spacing,
            hierarchy, typography, and imagery, while still maintaining a minimalist style.

        <h3>Enhance Information Layout</h3>
        <p>
            I redesigned the product detail page into a scrollable layout, clearly organizing product information into categories such as price, style, and specifications.

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>
                SnapBuy was my first project where I completed the entire design process—from defining the problem and building initial prototypes to conducting usability testing and iterating based on real user feedback. Experiencing this full cycle gave me a deeper understanding of how design decisions evolve over time.
            </p>
            <p>
               The most valuable takeaway for me was learning how to efficiently extract meaningful insights from user testing and translate them into design adjustments. I learned to re-examine initial assumptions, challenge early design directions, and optimize the UX in a more targeted manner.
