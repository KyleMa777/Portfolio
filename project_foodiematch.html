            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                This project began with a familiar problem: tourists are often overwhelmed by endless restaurant options in unfamiliar places. Working as a team of four, we reimagined this moment of decision by turning restaurant discovery into a playful, swipe-based experience inspired by dating apps.
            </p>
            <p>
                Across the term, I led major stages of the process: secondary research and competitor analysis, eight semi-structured interviews, persona creation, early task flows and sketches, and iterative prototyping from low-fidelity screens to the final interactive prototype.
            </p>

            <h2>Discovery & Research</h2>
            <p>
                I begin the research with 8 semi-structured interviews. The data revealed three core insights that guided the design direction:

                Before moving into high fidelity, I mapped the core flows with medium to low fidelity wireframes to test usability and interaction flows.

            <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
            <p>
                With the initial prototype in place, we ran eight moderated, task-based usability sessions with participants who regularly use restaurant apps on their phones. Each session followed a realistic scenario: planning dinner for a small group, from setting preferences to completing a booking.
            </p>
            <p>
                Using a "think aloud" protocol, we asked participants to verbalize what they were looking for, what they expected to happen next, and where they felt unsure while they moved through key tasks.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here are some critical feedbacks from user testing:

                <h4>Unclear feedback for "Like/Dislike" interaction</h4>
                <p>
                    Many participants were confused about what happened after tapping the heart icon. 
                    They expected immediate feedback or a visible "saved" state, and were unsure where the 
                    saved restaurants would appear.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="insight-card">
                <h4>Insufficient decision support</h4>
                <p>
                    Early versions of the prototype provided only minimal restaurant information. 
                    Participants hesitated to "Like" or "Pass" because they don't have enough information such as
                    menus, hours, ratings, or location.

                    Participants mentioned wanting to "check with friends first" before 
                    making a reservation.

            <div class="insight-card">
                <h4>Demand for Predictive Recommendations</h4>
                <p>
                    Instead of repeatedly searching with manually inputted preferences, participants expect the app 
                    to learn from their preferences and provides personalized recommendations.

            <h2>The Pivot: Iterating Based on Feedback</h2>
            <p>
                Usability testing surfaced three critical gaps in the early prototype. Each one turned into a
                concrete design pivot that made Foodie Match clearer, more informative, and more aligned with
                how people actually decide where to eat.

                <p>
                    Participants were unsure what happened after tapping the heart icon and whether a
                    restaurant had truly been saved. I added a lightweight confirmation overlay
                    ("Added! Saved to your list") to provide immediate feedback and reduce uncertainty.

                    Early versions did not show enough information for users to confidently "Like" or "Pass".
                    I introduced a scrollable detail view with hours, location, rating breakdown, tags, and a
                    gallery so users can understand the restaurant before making a decision.

                    Many participants wanted to "check with friends first" before booking. I added a social
                    layer with profile creation, friend selection, and a dedicated share flow.

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>
                My biggest takeaway from this project is understanding how thoughtful UX design can guide users through overwhelming choices and reduce the cognitive load behind decision-making. This project also sharpened my own design approach.
            </p>
            <p>
                Interactions with participants revealed frustrations, motivations, and decision-making habits I hadn't previously considered. User testing made these insights tangible: direct feedback from users and moments of confusion pinpointed areas needing improvement. Thanks to these invaluable tests, each iteration felt purposeful and yielded tangible results.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the future, I would love to explore core components such as the recommendation algorithm and further develop Foodie Match into a fully realized, real-world product.
